<u> Objective: </u> 
     
- Build the frontend for a really basic tweeting website that interacts with an already existing backend.
    - (one can take inspiration of the tweet from the notekeeping assignment)
- Once authenticated using the login form we created during Week 3,
the frontend should allow users to post, edit, and delete short messages with media and to view posts from other users.
- And ofc, integrate that with the backend for functionality.
